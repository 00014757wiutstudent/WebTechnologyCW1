                                <p>The history of the company begins with its founder, Kayumov Khusamiddin. In 2006, Khusamiddin and his partners founded Burger. The first outlet was opened at the bus stop - this is how the family business began selling pita bread, burgers and other fast food products.Since then, the company began to gain invaluable experience every day and make really tasty and beloved lavash. The assortment of dishes was constantly replenished, there were more buyers - more and more people could adequately appreciate the quality of dishes made with love and conscience. And then, when the company was just starting its journey, a dream, an idea or even a desire to create something unique, innovative and useful appeared! It was with these goals that the development of the company took place.</p>
                                <p>Creating a corporate culture, we tried to surround ourselves with like-minded people - those who share our principles and values. We especially appreciated those who will not leave the company in the most difficult times and will continue to believe in its success and do everything to come to it and take new heights!</p>

                            <p>In 2011, the company changed its name and became known as EVOS - as a reflection of the global goal of innovation and evolution in everything - in the range and quality of new dishes, in the ever-growing requirements for the quality of service, for the qualifications of staff.
